      <p>
        My name is Lazaro Perez. I'm 39 and work as the LMS Platform Developer and Content Developer for BMW of North
        America. I'm here to learn how to code so I can better do my current job.
      </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I have 16 years of experience in e-Learning course development and design, Adult Learning, LMS migrations and
        set-ups. I have used Sum Total, Click 2 Learn, Docent, and would be considered expert level in CornerStone On
        Demand. I am the NY Metro Area User group leader for Lectora, an e-learning devlopment program created by
        Trivantis.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Outside of work I am a single parent to an 18 year old daughter. I enjoy just about anything. I pass most of my
        time caught up in one home construction project or another, if not in my home then helping a friend work on
        their home. I am a tech geek that enjoys setting up home automation routines in my house and am always making
        changes where possible to make my home more of a "smart home". Humor and being easy going is important to me.
        I'm super funny, super awesome, and super modest. :-)
